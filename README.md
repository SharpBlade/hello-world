hello-world
===========

A project showing basic usage of SharpBlade.

SharpBlade Library
==================

SharpBlade is a C# wrapper/implementation for the SwitchBlade UI API.  It's built using the SwitchBlade UI SDK from Razer.

Implementation
==============

For this example project, I am simplifying the usage of SharpBlade by including a static build of it from the latest commit of today (5th January 2014) which is SharpBlade/SharpBlade@896c0a24861d650977785515fa1310d7f8f8a2af .
