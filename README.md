hello-world
===========

A project showing basic usage of SharpBlade.

SharpBlade Library
------------------

SharpBlade is a C# wrapper/implementation for the SwitchBlade UI API.  It's built using the SwitchBlade UI SDK from Razer.

Usage
-----

For this example project, I am simplifying the usage of SharpBlade by including a static build of it from the latest commit of today (5th January 2014) which is [896c0a24861d650977785515fa1310d7f8f8a2af][publishcommit].

I've commented the code heavily with explanations on using the application.
